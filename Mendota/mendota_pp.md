Advantage Auto MGA **–** Quick Photo Privacy Policy

Effective Date: December 13, 2019

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. This Privacy Policy applies to information collected through
Advantage Auto MGA – Quick Photo (“Quick Photo”). By using Quick Photo, you acknowledge that
you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and the Advantage Auto MGA – Quick Photo End User
License Agreement. Note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through any
means other than Quick Photo, including information that you provide to Advantage Auto MGA offline.
References to “Advantage Auto MGA,” “we,” “our,” “us,” or variations of any of these, shall mean
Advantage Auto MGA.

Children
Quick Photo is not intended for children. Children should not use Quick Photo for any purpose, even
with the permission of their parents. Advantage Auto MGA will not knowingly allow anyone under 13 to
provide any personally identifying information. If you are under 13, please do not provide any
information about yourself through Quick Photo.

Information Collected
Advantage Auto MGA collects information in two ways: through information you voluntarily submit
using Quick Photo (“User-Provided Information”) and through your installation and use of Quick Photo.
All information that may be used to identify you will be treated as Personal Information.

- User-Provided Information
    One way Advantage Auto MGA collects information is by you providing that information. To
    use Quick Photo, you may be required to provide personal information (e.g., information that
    can be used to identify you), which may include your first and last name, email address, mailing
    address, telephone number, insurance claim number, and Vehicle Identification Number
    (“VIN”). In addition, Quick Photo allows users to allow insurance carrier representatives to take
    screen shots of, or to upload photographic images, videos of damaged vehicles and damage
    description text to assist in the preparation of vehicle damage repair estimates (collectively, the
    “User Photographs and Videos”). You are solely responsible for the content of the User
    Photographs and Videos you upload to Quick Photo or allow the insurance carrier
    representatives to take screen shots of through Quick Photo; please be careful in selecting what
    images to include as part of your submission or allowing the video chat to continue without
    pause so that the insurance carrier representatives cannot take screen shots of videos that you do
    not want to share.
- Mobile Device Type and Operating System Information
    Quick Photo automatically collects information about your mobile device type, operating
    system, location information and camera settings.
