QuickPicClaim Privacy Policy

Effective Date: December 12, 2019

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. This Privacy Policy applies to information collected through
QuickPicClaim (“QuickPicClaim”). QuickPicClaim is provided to you by CCC Information Services on
behalf of your insurance carrier or your insurance carrier’s third-party administrator (“insurance carrier”).
By using QuickPicClaim, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and the
QuickPicClaim End User License Agreement. Note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to information
collected through any means other than QuickPicClaim, including information that you provide to your
insurance carrier or CCC outside of QuickPicClaim. References to “CCC,” “we,” “our,” “us,” or
variations of any of these, shall mean CCC Information Services Inc and its affiliates, acting as service
provider to your insurance carrier.

Information Collected
CCC collects information in two ways: through information you voluntarily submit using QuickPicClaim
and through your installation and use of QuickPicClaim.

- User-Provided Information
    One way CCC collects information is by you providing that information. When you use
    QuickPicClaim, you may provide your user ID, name, email address, telephone number,
    insurance claim number, Vehicle Identification Number (“VIN”), the name of the individual
    recording the User Photographs and Videos and other vehicle information such as make, model,
    color of your vehicle, vehicle options. In addition, QuickPicClaim allows users to upload and
    allows insurance carrier representatives to take screen shots of and/or to upload, photographic
    images and videos of damaged vehicles (collectively, the “User Photographs and Videos”). You
    are solely responsible for the content of the User Photographs and Videos and other content you
    upload to QuickPicClaim or allow the insurance carrier representatives to take screen shots of
    through QuickPicClaim; please be careful in selecting what images to include as part of your
    submission or allowing the video chat to continue without pause so that the insurance carrier
    representatives cannot take screen shots of videos that you do not want to share.
- Information Collected Automatically
    QuickPicClaim also automatically collects information such as device ID, IP address, location
    based on your IP address, browser language, browser type, and GPS location of uploaded
    photographic images and videos. Additionally, through the use of cookies and other tracking
    mechanisms (described in more detail below), we may collect, where applicable and without

    traffic received by other websites that directed traffic to QuickPicClaim.
