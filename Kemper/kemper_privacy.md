## KEMPER PHOTO CLAIMS PRIVACY POLICY

Effective Date: 22 / 02 / 2020

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. This privacy policy applies to information collected
through Kemper Photo Claims. By using Kemper Photo Claims, you acknowledge that you have
read and understood this Privacy Policy. Note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to
information collected through any means other than Kemper Photo Claims, including
information that you provide to us offline.

**Information Collected**

Kemper Photo Claims collects information in two ways: through information you voluntarily
submit using Kemper Photo Claims (“User-Provided Information”) and through your installation
and use of Kemper Photo Claims. All information that may be used to identify you will be
treated as Personal Information.

**User-Provided Information** is information we collect that is provided by you. To use Kemper
Photo Claims, you may be required to provide personal information (e.g. information that can be
used to identify you), which may include, but is not limited to:

- Contact details, such as your first and last name, email address, mailing address, and
    telephone number;
- Account login credentials, such as username and password;
- Comments, feedback, and other information such as photographs and videos you submit;
- Insurance policy number, vehicle identification number, and claim information including
    claim number, documentation or information relating to such a claim.

```
In addition, Kemper Photo Claims allows Kemper, its affiliates and representatives to take
screen shots of, or to upload photographs, video of damaged vehicles and damage
description text to assist in the preparation of vehicle damage repair estimates. You are
solely responsible for the content of any photographs or videos you upload to Kemper Photo
Claims.
```
**Information Collected Automatically.** Kemper Photo Claims automatically collects
information such as device ID, IP address, location based on your IP address, browser language,
browser type, and GPS location of uploaded photographic images and videos.

**California Consumer Privacy Act Notice of Collection**

The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provides California Consumers certain
rights regarding their Personal Information (“PI”) as those terms are defined in the CCPA,
became effective on January 1, 2020. As of that date, the California Attorney General had not
completed the rule making process to establish the regulations for businesses to implement the
law.

In the meantime, we are providing you with notice of the PI we collect and our purposes for that
collection for data that may be subject to the CCPA (“CCPA Notice”). This CCPA Notice does
not cover information that is outside of the scope of the CCPA, including data we collect and
process as necessary to operate our insurance businesses, which is regulated by the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999.
This notice also does not apply to data collected from employees, applicants or contractors or to
data collected from individuals acting as representatives of another business in connection with
business communications or transactions.

We collect and share the following PI that may be subject to the CCPA for the following
purposes:

If you are a California Consumer and would like to register a request pursuant to your CCPA
“right to know about personal information collected, disclosed or sold” (including right to obtain
copies of specific pieces and/or information about categories of personal information practices),
“right to request deletion of personal information,” or “right to opt-out of the sale of personal
information,” you can contact us at CaliforniaPrivacy@kemper.com and we will respond to your
request when we are able to do so in accordance with the upcoming regulatory guidance on how
to properly verify you and respond to your requests.

We will revise this CCPA Privacy Notice from time to time as implementing regulations further
develop and take effect and we are able to provide you with better information on your CCPA
rights and how to exercise them.
